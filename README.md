# Generating-Cylindric-Partitions
This project aims to develop a script for generating cylindric partitions of numbers with various shapes λ/μ/d. 
Cylindric partitions involve additional relations between the first and the last rows of plane partitions, creating a 
cylindrical structure. The algorithm generated for the purpose of generating cylindric partitions takes an input of 
a list μ representing the number of spaces in each row. By considering a range of values for d and generating all 
the possible lists λ’s, which represents the length of each row, the algorithm is utilized to generate the possible 
valid cylindrical partitions with variously defined shapes
